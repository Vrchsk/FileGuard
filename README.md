# FileGuard

FileGuard is a digital evidence integrity checker that verifies whether
a file has been altered using cryptographic hashing.

## Use Case
- Cyber forensics
- Legal evidence validation
- Academic record verification

## How It Works
- Generates SHA-256 hash for a file
- Stores hash as evidence fingerprint
- Verifies file integrity on re-upload

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- HTML, CSS

## Future Scope
- Database-backed hash storage
- Blockchain-based evidence ledger
- Timestamped verification
